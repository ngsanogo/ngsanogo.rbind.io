Hi!

My name is Issa Sanogo. I am a Data Engineer.

This is my personal website and blog.

## What's Inside

- **Blog**: Technical posts organized by topics and series
- **Resume**: My full professional background and skills
- **About**: A bit about me and what I do
- **Contact**: My contact information

## Running This Site Locally

Want to see the site on your computer? Here's how:

### You'll Need

- [Hugo Extended](https://gohugo.io/installation/) (version 0.152.2 or newer)
- Git

### Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Get the code
git clone https://github.com/ngsanogo/ngsanogo.rbind.io.git
cd ngsanogo.rbind.io

# 2. Start the site
hugo server -D
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:1313` and you'll see the site!

### Writing a New Post

```bash
hugo new content/posts/my-new-post.md
```

Then edit the file in your favorite editor and save. Hugo will automatically refresh your browser!

## How It Works

This is a static website built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), using the [hugo-coder](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/) theme. When I push changes to GitHub, [Netlify](https://netlify.com) automatically builds and deploys the site.

Simple as that!
