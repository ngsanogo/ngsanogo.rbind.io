## What is PostgreSQL?

PostgreSQL is a database. A powerful, reliable, free database.

It's not the fanciest or fastest. But it's solid. People trust it.

## Why It Matters

As a data engineer, you'll encounter PostgreSQL constantly:

- Companies use it for their main application
- Data warehouses are built on it (or similar)
- Your data pipelines likely read from or write to PostgreSQL
- Your local development environment probably uses it

Knowing PostgreSQL = understanding how data actually moves through companies.

## PostgreSQL vs Other Databases

**MySQL**: Simpler, sometimes faster, less reliable in edge cases.

**SQL Server**: Powerful, proprietary, expensive.

**MongoDB**: No-SQL, different philosophy, good for unstructured data.

**BigQuery/Snowflake**: Cloud data warehouses, expensive, built for analytics.

**PostgreSQL**: Balanced. Reliable. Free. Good for everything. That's why companies choose it.

## What Can PostgreSQL Do?

Store structured data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  signup_date DATE
);
```

Query it efficiently:

```sql
SELECT name, email
FROM customers
WHERE signup_date > '2025-01-01'
ORDER BY signup_date DESC;
```

Combine data from multiple tables:

```sql
SELECT
  c.name,
  COUNT(o.id) as orders,
  SUM(o.amount) as total_spent
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.id, c.name;
```

Ensure data quality:

```sql
ALTER TABLE customers
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_email CHECK (email LIKE '%@%.%');
```

Process millions of records in seconds.

## Real-World Usage

**Your company's main database**: Stores customers, orders, products, everything.

**Your ETL pipeline**: Reads from the main database, transforms data, loads into a warehouse.

**Your local development**: Clone of the production database for testing.

**Reporting**: Monthly reports generated by SQL queries against PostgreSQL.

## How to Work With PostgreSQL

### Access it

```bash
# Connect from terminal
psql -U username -d database_name -h localhost

# You're now in PostgreSQL
# Type SQL commands
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

### Browse what's there

```sql
-- Show all tables
\dt

-- Show columns in a table
\d customers

-- Show all databases
\l
```

### Explore the data

```sql
-- How many records?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;

-- What date range?
SELECT MIN(created_at), MAX(created_at) FROM orders;

-- Any nulls?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers WHERE email IS NULL;

-- Duplicates?
SELECT email, COUNT(*)
FROM customers
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Write and run queries

```sql
-- Extract data
SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) as total
FROM orders
WHERE date >= '2025-01-01'
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Save results to a new table
CREATE TABLE monthly_summary AS
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) as month,
  COUNT(*) as order_count,
  SUM(amount) as revenue
FROM orders
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date);
```

## Why PostgreSQL is Reliable

**ACID guarantees**: Your data is consistent. If something fails, nothing breaks.

**Full-featured**: Handles complex queries, large datasets, concurrent users.

**Proven**: Used by companies for 20+ years. Millions of deployments.

**Community**: Free help, documentation, forums.

**No vendor lock-in**: SQL knowledge transfers to other databases.

## Common PostgreSQL Tasks

**Check database size**

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('mydb'));
```

**Find slow queries**

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Backup your database**

```bash
pg_dump mydb > backup.sql
```

**Restore from backup**

```bash
psql mydb < backup.sql
```

**Monitor connections**

```sql
SELECT usename, count(*)
FROM pg_stat_activity
GROUP BY usename;
```

## Real Example: Data Pipeline

You have a PostgreSQL database with customer orders. You need to:

1. Extract orders from last 24 hours
2. Calculate customer spending patterns
3. Identify high-value customers
4. Load results into a summary table

```sql
-- Extract and transform in one SQL command
INSERT INTO customer_summary (customer_id, order_count, total_spent, avg_order)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  COUNT(*) as order_count,
  SUM(amount) as total_spent,
  AVG(amount) as avg_order
FROM orders
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

Done. The pipeline runs. Data is ready for analysis.

## Getting Started Locally

1. Install PostgreSQL (free, takes 5 minutes)
2. Create a test database
3. Load sample data
4. Write queries

Start asking your own questions about the data.

As you practice, you'll become fluent in PostgreSQL. Then you understand how data actually works in the real world.

## Why This Matters

PostgreSQL is not exciting. No flashy features. No marketing hype.

But it's used in millions of production systems handling billions of dollars of transactions daily.

Understanding PostgreSQL = understanding how real companies handle data.

That knowledge is valuable forever.
