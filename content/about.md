Hi, my name is Issa Sanogo and welcome to my personal website.

I'm currently working as a freelancer, having previously served as a Data Engineer at the Jérôme Lejeune Institute and as a Data Manager at AP-HP. I consider myself an expert in life sciences data.

I earned my MSc in Mathematical Engineering applied to Life Sciences from the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Paris Cité in 2017.

I’m a passionate advocate of open source and continually strive to improve my development skills.

This blog showcases my personal projects, with a focus on data and open source software.
